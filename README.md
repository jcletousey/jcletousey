ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jcletousey, a software developper, based in Caen, France.

## Technical

- I mostly use _Typescript_ and _Python_ on my day-to-day job
- But, I also work with _CSS_ when working on the front-end (which happens often ðŸ˜‰)
- And, I'm also involve in the _DevOps_ part

## Personal

I have [my own place](https://jcletousey.dev/) where I experiment and blog sometimes.
